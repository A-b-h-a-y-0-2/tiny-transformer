WORK THROUGH FOR TASK 1-
1-Recreation of EdgeViT and using cifar100 to train it
2-Fine tuning through different methods like
	A)initial hyperparameter fine-tuning on A paper mentioning finetuning over cifar10 and cifar100 datasets.
	B)Optuna based hyperparameter tuning
3-Usage of EfficientFormer model from Hugging face, and finetuning it based on the hyperparameter found in the optuna fine-tuning.

WORK THROUGH FOR TASK 2-
1- Recreated the transformer backbone from the paper,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12098", MSW-Transformer: Multi-Scale Shifted Windows
Transformer Networks for 12-Lead ECG Classification.
2- Haven't put through training due to lack of resources but implementation is created based on the details that are available in the paper.
3- data loading is set up through the findings of paper "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04229"
